EU_tutorial.10.t코0=Chapter 1 - The European Union
EU_tutorial.10.d코0=§Y[EUU.GetFlag] The European Union§! is a unique economic and political union between its member states.\n\nThe EU is similar to a confederation, where many policy areas are federalised into common institutions capable of making law; however the member states are sovereign nations but they have limited their sovereignty and transfered some of their powers to the supranational union.\n\nWhat began as a purely economic union has evolved into an organization spanning policy areas, from climate, environment and health to external relations and security, justice and migration. A name change from the European Economic Community (EEC) to the European Union (EU) in 1993 reflected this.

EU_tutorial.11.t코0=Chapter 1.1 - The European Union in Millennium Dawn
EU_tutorial.11.d코0=In Millennium Dawn §Y[EUU.GetFlag] The European Union§! is not a playable nation (there is an EUU tag for some coding reasons, but this is not a regular Hearts of Iron country). In the mod the EU is represented and played by the member states. Later in the game the player has the possibility to unite (annex) the member states under one cosmetic tag. Two main factors that drive the EU are the influence on the other member states and the Euroscepticism. Besides that the EU is controlled via the EU Focus Tree and Decisions.
EU_tutorial.11.a코0=Next Page

EU_tutorial.12.t코0=Chapter 1.2 - Institutions of the European Union
EU_tutorial.12.d코0=The EU has six main institutions\n\n- the European Parliament\n- the European Council\n- the Council of the European Union\n- the European Commission\n- the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU)\n- European Central Bank (ECB)
EU_tutorial.12.a코0=Next Page

EU_tutorial.13.t코0=Chapter 1.2 - Institutions of the European Union (p.2)
EU_tutorial.13.d코0=In the EU's unique institutional set-up:0\n\n- the EU's broad priorities are set by the European Council, which brings together national and EU-level leaders\n- directly elected MEPs represent European citizens in the European Parliament\n- the interests of the EU as a whole are promoted by the European Commission, whose members are appointed by national governments\n -governments defend their own country's national interests in the Council of the European Union.

EU_tutorial.15.t코0=Chapter 1.3 - Council, Huh?
EU_tutorial.15.d코0=In European politics there are known three institutions with the name Council:0 the Council of Europe, the European Council and the Council of the European Union.\n\nThe Council of Europe is an international organisation whose stated aim is to uphold human rights, democracy and the rule of law in Europe. The best known body of the Council of Europe is the European Court of Human Rights, which enforces the European Convention on Human Rights. Its not an institution of the European Union and therefore its not in the mod.
EU_tutorial.15.a코0=Next Page

EU_tutorial.16.t코0=Chapter 1.3 - Council, Huh? (p.2)
EU_tutorial.16.d코0=The European Council is a collective body that defines the European Union's overall political direction and priorities. It comprises the heads of state or government of the EU member states, along with the President of the European Council and the President of the European Commission. While the European Council has no legislative power, it is a strategic (and crisis-solving) body that provides the union with general political directions and priorities, and acts as a collective presidency.
EU_tutorial.16.a코0=Next Page

EU_tutorial.17.t코0=Chapter 1.3 - Council, Huh? (p.3)
EU_tutorial.17.d코0=The Council of the European Union (in the treaties simply the Council) is one of two legislative bodies together with the European Parliament. The Council represents the executive governments of the EU's member states and has a between the member states rotating Presidency.\n\nIn Millennium Dawn the European Council and the Council of the European Union are combined and represented by the voting of the member states. The President of the European Council is a claimable office in the mod, while the rotating Presidency of the Council of the European Union is not implemented at the moment.

EU_tutorial.20.t코0=Chapter 2 - The EU Focus Tree
EU_tutorial.20.d코0=The EU Focus Tree is other than any other Focus Tree in the game. The EU Focus Tree is a shared focus tree and does not only belong to a single country, but to all (49 potential) member states. Every EU member state has the shared EU Focus Tree, but these trees are connected. Only one member state can complete a shared voting focus at the same time. If a focus for one country is completed it is bypassed for every other member state. There is one exceptions to this:0 the Withdrawal Policies branch.

EU_tutorial.21.t코0=Chapter 2.1 - The Voting Tree
EU_tutorial.21.d코0=The Voting Tree consists of all other branches than the Withdrawal Policies branch. The focuses of the Voting Tree apply there effect not simply through completing the focus, they need to be accepted by the voting of the member states. The only effects that are directly applied are the Euroscepticism bonuses and malus. Some of the branch header have no (other) effect and need no voting. As the focuses need to be accepted by the voting of the member states, there are no mutually exclusive focuses. But some focuses are mutually exclusive in the result. If one is accepted the other can't be completed. See the requires tooltip for details.
EU_tutorial.21.a코0=Next Page

EU_tutorial.22.t코0=Chapter 2.2 - The Withdrawal Tree
EU_tutorial.22.d코0=The Withdrawal Policies branch is like a normal focus tree. The focuses there are not linked to focuses of other member states and there is no voting on the exit focuses.
EU_tutorial.22.a코0=Next Page

EU_tutorial.23.t코0=Chapter 2.3 - The Member State Focuses
EU_tutorial.23.d코0=The Member State Focuses is unique for every member state. Regularly there is no voting on these focuses. The Member State Focuses reflect how the national policies of a member state could influence the policies of the whole Union. The Member State Focuses are located and integrated in the national tree of the specific member state.

EU_tutorial.31.t코0=Chapter 3.1 - The Voting Decisions
EU_tutorial.31.d코0=The first decision of the voting proceeding is the voting decision. It becomes available if the proposing country has at least 3% influence on any other member state or holds one of the three major offices of the EU (President of the European Commission, President of the European Council, President of the European Parliament). When the decision is selected every member states gets a Yes/No voting event.
EU_tutorial.31.a코0=Next Page

EU_tutorial.32.t코0=Chapter 3.1 - The Voting Decisions (p.2)
EU_tutorial.32.d코0=After the vote the result decision becomes available. When selected the result of the voting is shown by a sequence of two events. If the proposal was accepted the effect of the focus is applied to every member state by the event. If the proposal was dismissed the retry proceeding is started.\n\nNote:0 In some rare circumstances the voting process could be locked. In this case you have to wait round about three month til the voting is cleared in the background. Than just try again.
EU_tutorial.32.a코0=Next Page

EU_tutorial.33.t코0=Chapter 3.1 - The Voting Decisions (p.3)
EU_tutorial.33.d코0=90 days after the dismissal the retry decision becomes available for every member state. If one member state selects that decision the decision is removed for every other member state and a new voting decision becomes visible for the member state. So that member state can start the voting proceeding again. The AI (in this order President of the European Commission, President of the European Council or President of the European Parliament) will take the retry decision. If you want to select the retry, you should pause the game or disable the AI retry. The retry of the AI can be disabled via a decision.
EU_tutorial.33.a코0=Next Page

EU_tutorial.34.t코0=Chapter 3.2 - The AI Voting
EU_tutorial.34.d코0=The voting behaviour of the AI is determined by three factors:0 the influence of the proposing country (5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 50%), the Eurosceptisim of the voting country (10%, 20%, 30%, 50%, 70%) and the government resist factor of the voting country. The government resist factor reflects the attitude of the political parties towards the subject of the voting. There are four stance:0 strongly resist, resist, support and stronly support (you can see the government resist factor in the Focus Tree at the focus effect tooltip).

EU_tutorial.37.t코0=Chapter 3.3 - Majority Types (p.3) - QMV
EU_tutorial.37.d코0=In the case of Qualified Majority Voting (QMV) there are two majorities that have to be met:0 55% of the member states who represent 65% of the Population of the EU have to vote for the proposal to be accepted. Therefore member states who together represent 35% of the Population of the EU have a blocking minority.

EU_tutorial.41.d코0=There are two kinds of national spirits for EU member states. The first one are crisis or negative circumstances that are applied by events or from the start. The effect of some of the focuses are to remove or prevent these negative national spirits when the voting is accepted. The other one apply bonuses to the member states. They are added when the proposal is accepted by the voting of the member states.

EU_tutorial.50.d코0=In the EU every institution has a head. In this sense the Offices of the EU in the mod are the personification and the representation of these institutions. In the tradition of the European Union these offices are shared among the member states. So it is in Millennium Dawn. In general a member state can only hold one office at once. To claim an office a member state needs at least 5% influence on every other member state or a population of more than 5% of the Total EU Population. So it is more likly that the most offices are shared among the big member states.

EU_tutorial.60.t코0=Chapter 6 - Euroscepticism
EU_tutorial.60.d코0=Euroscepticism is one of the basic concepts for the EU in Millennium Dawn.\n\nEuroscepticism, also known as EU-scepticism, means criticism of the European Union (EU) and European integration. According to public opinion surveys this ratio represents the number of people who will likely vote for leaving the European Union in the case of a European Union membership referendum of their country.\nEuropeanism also known as Pro-Europeanism, sometimes called European Unionism, is a political position that favours European integration and membership of the European Union (EU). It includes the more radical European federalists, who seek to create a single superstate known informally as a United States of Europe. A related term is ’Europhile’. The ratio represents the Europhile people throughout the whole Union.\n\nEuroscepticism is one of the main variable driving the EU member states in one direction or the other. Europeanism on the other hand is just a derivative variable from Euroscepticism. It is used as trigger to refer to the Union as a whole.

EU_tutorial.62.d코0=One source of Euroscepticism are the focuses on completition. Most of them add Euroscepticism to all current and potential member states. Some add a special amount to certain countries. This reflects the unique national tradition in some policies areas, like financial discipline in the nothern countries or soft currency in the southern member states.\n\nAnother source of Euroscepticism are the Euroscepticism Campaign Decisions. On the other side of the coin the Pro-European Campaigns can reduce the Euroscepticism.\n\nFinally there are some events and decision, which can add or reduce the Euroscepticism. E.g. the OMT Program decisions.

EU_tutorial.63.t코0=Chapter 6.3 - Euroscepticism and EU Exit
EU_tutorial.63.d코0=Euroscepticism will drive the AI to EU Exit. From 50% Euroscepticism the probability of an exit rises in 10% steps with rising Euroscepticism. But Euroscepticism is not the only factor for an EU exit. The probability from the Euroscepticism is modified by the ruling party. Governments with nationalist outlook will always try to leave the Union. Conservative governments are pro-European in general, but they flip over in the exit camp, when Euroscepticism rises above 60%. All other major European parties try to stay in the EU, but somewhere above 70% Euroscepticism they can't ignore the will of the people.
