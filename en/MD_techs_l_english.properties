body_armor_1980코0=Kevlar Vest
body_armor_1980_desc코0=The first modern body armours before the famous Kevlar vests were mainly made of nylon. Kevlar was first introduced in 1975, and the first vests were adopted to the US Army in the 1980s.\n\nThe first vests offered protection only to the upper torso, and they only protected from shrapnel and pistol rounds.
body_armor_2000코0=Plate Reinforced Vest
body_armor_2000_desc코0=Even though ceramics have been used in personal protection for long, the first modern ballistic plates were introduced in late 90s and early 2000s. The ballistic plates in these new vests would provide protection from rifle rounds, and shrapnel protection of the vest itself would extend to groinal and neck areas and not just the upper torso.
body_armor_2010코0=Improved Tactical Vest
body_armor_2010_desc코0=While offering great protection, plate reinforced vests can be cumbersome to the user. This lead to several body armour manufacturers to look for more lighter and tactical designs. While also providing protection, body armour shouldn't limit a soldiers ability to operate on the field. Modern body armours offer integrated solutions where the tactical vests allow personal customisation by the user, making the same vest usable in almost every situation. The protective capabilities are also improved, as modern body armour is capable of even stopping armour piercing bullets.
body_armor_2030코0=Tactical Assault Suite
body_armor_2030_desc코0=It's no longer necessary to just protect soldiers from bullets and shrapnel. The armour soldiers are wearing also has to provide them assistance in the form of an exoskeleton, environmental protection and augmented reality displays. In addition, instead of using heavy ceramic plates, the protective technology should take advantage of the elastic properties of liquids.

camouflage코0=Early Camouflage
camouflage_desc코0=While camouflage has been used in the military for centuries, in military uniforms they really started gaining popularity post-Worl War 2. The first camouflage patterns usually consisted of two or three colours almost equally distributed on the uniform.
camouflage2코0=Multi-Scale Camouflage
camouflage2_desc코0=Multi-Scale camouflage improves the basic camouflage by applying a range of scales to the color patterns of the uniform. This mixes smaller coloured areas on a background colour in a fractal like pattern. This mimicks the colour schemes of nature, making the camouflage more effective in multiple environments and at varying ranges.
camouflage3코0=Digital Camouflage
camouflage3_desc코0=Digital camouflage is an improvement over the multi-scale camouflage as the created pattern is calculated by computers. Though digital camouflage is often used specifically to refer to a pixelated pattern form, digital camouflage doesn't necessarily equate the pattern to be made of squares.
camouflage4코0=Personal Multispectral Camouflage
camouflage4_desc코0=Multispectral camouflage refers to camouflage techniques that are used to hide objects from infrared or radar based detection. For individual soldier this has mainly been available in the form ghillie suits, which are impractical in most combat situation. With modern materials, effective infrared shielding coatings and materials can be applied to the battledress of every soldier.
camouflage5코0=Thermoptic Camouflage
camouflage5_desc코0=With reflective materials, we can not only fool the human eye, but completely hide objects from it. By bending electromagnetic radiation, we can make weapon installation, vehicles, weapons and even soldiers almost invisible to the human eye.

modern_blitzkrieg코0=Modern Blitzkrieg
modern_blitzkrieg_desc코0=Incredibly successful in the opening stages of World War 2, Germany's Blitzkrieg Doctrine was widely copied by others, becoming a mainstay of Cold War strategic thought - especially in NATO circles. It aims to concentrate mobile forces, using them to continuously maneuver into enemy territory whilst avoiding enemy strong points.
forward_defense코0=Forward Defense
forward_defense_desc코0=NATO strategists, in countering the threat of Soviet armor overrunning Western Europe, came up with the doctrine of Forward Defense. Pre-planned defensive forces armed with anti-tank and anti-air weapons would starve off the initial push while reserves would be mobilized behind them. The idea was that the initial titanic-sized battles would determine the outcome of the war, and thus the majority of active forces should be placed as close to the front as possible.
encourage_nco_iniative코0=Encourage NCO Initiative
encourage_nco_iniative_desc코0=Western military thought encouraged initiative among non-commissioned officers (lower-level command), viewing them as the backbone of their armies. With rapidly changing situations, avoiding having to go through the entire chain of command allows an NCO to exploit opportunities on the battlefield that would otherwise be missed.
air_land_battle코0=AirLand Battle
air_land_battle_desc코0=AirLand Battle emphasized close coordination between land forces acting as an aggressively maneuvering defense, with air forces attacking rear-echelon forces feeding the enemy front line, taking pressure off the enemy’s main advance. The aim is to delay the enemy, creating a window of opportunity to defeat front line forces while delivering severe attrition to their rear.
grand_battleplan코0=Grand Battleplan
grand_battleplan_desc코0=The Grand Battleplan doctrine favors the pre-planning of each stage of combat extensively, holding the view that the side with the best planning would prevail. When done correctly, it can be very powerful, as troops can concentrate on perfecting their aspect of the plan, while allowing combined operations in forces incapable of real-time coordination. While good planning avoids logistical problems, it is slow work, redicing initiative and having no real flexibility in the face of a fluid front line.
rigid_hierarchy코0=Rigid Hierarchy
rigid_hierarchy_desc코0=With the legitimate fear that one’s own army poses the greatest threat to regime survival, commanding positions would often be done out of political loyality instead of competance. Large, live-fire excersises would generally not be held. Furthermore, desicion-making would be centralized, making it slow and inflexible in the face of evolving threats.
praetorian_guard코0=Praetorian Guard
praetorian_guard_desc코0=With the political leadership focusing the army on regime protection, elite seperate units were set up that employed professional soldiers with ideological selection and training. These would recieve the best weapons and training, making them well-placed to defend the political leadership from uprisings and the threat of coups by the normal conscripted army.
armoured_mass_assault코0=Mass Armoured Assault
armoured_mass_assault_desc코0=Mass Armoured Assault, under the Soviet concept of "Deep Battle" stressed combined arms cooperation, offensive action, and heavily armored shock units. Multiple attacks would be made on a single front by slower, firepower-heavy units in order to break the enemy tactical zone. At the same time, highly mobile armored and mechanized forces would be held in reserve, advancing into the front once gaps are created. This is distinct from Blitzkreig, which focuses on single weak-points instead of multiple points of contact.
deep_echelon_advance코0=Deep Echelon Advance
deep_echelon_advance_desc코0=With gaps in enemy lines sucessfully created, several advances of heavily armored shock troops would ravage the enemy rear at a high speed while avoiding strong points of enemy resistance - leaving them to follow the advances of less heavy infantry forces. The goal is to sieze enemy territory at an breakneck speed, creating the conditions whereby the enemy loses the will to mount an operational defence.
army_group_operational_freedom코0=Army Group Operational Freedom
army_group_operational_freedom_desc코0=While rigid in tactical disposition, the Soviet doctrine allowed significant operational freedom to army group formations, enabling ground commanders to make quick decisions. This freedom was larger than among NATO forces at the time, but it did not extend down to lower officers and commanders.
massed_artillery코0=Massed Artillery
massed_artillery_desc코0=Using large amounts of both regular artillery and rocket artillery concentrated at the frontline enemy, the hope was to break and disrupt their normal functions. Using artillery in such numbers also reduces the need for air support. The sheer numbers led many to call both the Russian and Soviet Armies as an "artillery army with tanks".
infiltration_assault코0=Infiltration Assault
infiltration_assault_desc코0=The Infiltration Assault doctrine uses night-time infiltration behind enemy strong points to allow suprise assults at normally well-defended positions to succeed by cutting them off from reinforcements.
defence_in_depth코0=Defense in Depth
defence_in_depth_desc코0=Defense in Depth, often also called "elastic defense", is all about delaying instead of outright denying the advance of the enemy. Supply depots and pre-made fortifications should be placed far from the front, as should the majority of forces. By buying time and causing additional enemy casualties by yielding space, the enemy momentum will wear down from attrition.
armoured_counterpunch코0=Armoured Counterpunch
armoured_counterpunch_desc코0=Building upon Defense in Depth, this strategy is about deploying significant armored forces at advantageous times in order to cut off deep echelon advances, achieving an decisive victory. However, such concentrations are vulnerable to enemy airpower.
frontline_defence코0=Frontline Defense
frontline_defence_desc코0=Massing the majority of pre-planned defensive forces as close to the border as possible yields us the largest chance of maintaining territory, which is essential if we have a limited area to retreat to.
early_tunnel_warfare코0=Early Tunnel Warfare

guerilla_specialisation코0=Guerilla Specialization
guerilla_specialisation_desc코0=Guerilla warfare seeks to disrupt the military superiority of the opponent by denying them direct combat except in the few areas where parity can be achieved through terrain advantages or ambushes. Also seeks to subject the enemy to constant attrition through attacks on softer targets, such as supply convoys.
Century_Re_Evaluation코0=21st Century Re-Evaluation

TITLE_DECENTRALIZED코0=Decentralized Warfare
DECENTRALIZED_WARFARE_TITLE코0=By decentralizing command structures and expanding informational warfare into all aspects of society, one can deny the enemy situational awareness and gain local operational advantages.
Decentralized_Warfare코0=Decentralized Warfare
Decentralized_Warfare_desc코0=Decentralized and asymmetric warfare has been pioneered by Iran and Russia. It assumes conflict against an networked and technological superior opponent can cripple the command and control structure. The answer has been to transform into smaller military units with independent desicion-making and command structures to remain combat effective. It also places great importance on warfare by alternative means and strong coordination with friendly locals to achieve an advantage in local information.
TITLE_GUERILLA코0=Guerilla Warfare
GUERILLA_WARFARE_TITLE코0=By denying a superior enemy desisive battle and instead attacking their support structure, they will be forced to disperse into smaller units we can catch by surprise. Bluring the lines between combatant and civilian, we spread chaos and demoralize the enemy into admitting defeat.
Guerilla_Warfare코0=Guerilla Warfare
Guerilla_Warfare_desc코0=Widely in usage by non-state actors, guerilla warfare seeks to disrupt the military superiority of the opponent by denying them direct combat except in the few areas where parity can be achieved through terrain or ambushes. Fighting towards a political end goal, non-military means such as psychological warfare are employed to wear down the opponent’s stability and will to fight. Ironically, through spreading chaos, we can build support for ourselves as the only stable alternative for society.
Civilian_Infiltration코0=Civilian Infiltration
Civilian_Infiltration_desc코0=The core of any successful insurgency is to blend in with the general population, both as protection and as grounds for recruitment, so that any targeted surgical action against the insurgency is impossible.

Human_Shield코0=Human Shield
Human_Shield_desc코0=Having the loyality of locals, we can protect ourselves from massive bombing from the opponent by basing ourselves in the close proximity of civilians. If we are bombed anyway, civilian casualities can be employed as propaganda to reduce the opponent’s war support.
Youth_Indoctination코0=Youth Indoctination
Youth_Indoctination_desc코0=By taking control over education, we can establish ideological indoctrinations of the youth to give us future soldiers willing to sacrifice everything for the cause.
Hit_and_Run_Tactics코0=Hit and Run Tactics
Hit_and_Run_Tactics_desc코0=Offensive Hit and Run Tactics seek to force the opponent to disperse their forces geographically, making them easier targets for us. At the same time, sucessful operations will enhance our image while minimizing losses.
Prison_Raids코0=Prison Raids
Prison_Raids_desc코0=By attacking prisons and releasing the prisoners, we can gain a fertile ground of recruitment as these prisoners will have gratitude towards us, likely taking up arms for our cause as they are yet unable to live a normal life.
Urban_Focus코0=Urban Focus
Urban_Focus_desc코0=By choosing to specialize in urban operations, we can make battlefield operations very messy for our opponent while making things smoother for us.
3D_Swarming코0=3D Swarming
3D_Swarming_desc코0=Using the urban cityscape to our advantage, we can move through multi-level buildings and approach the enemy from above and beneath, using multiple directions to concentrate lethal force to break the enemy in a sector.
No_Surrender코0=No Surrender
No_Surrender_desc코0=By basing ourselves in urban terrain, we become vulnerable to enemy encirclement. However, with no obvious way out, our forces gain the willpower to fight until death.
Rural_Focus코0=Rural Focus
Rural_Focus_desc코0=By choosing to specialize in rural operations, we can gain strength in the hinterlands where the opponent is weakest. We gain mobility and can afford to retreat if it is advantageus for us.
Tactical_Retreats코0=Tactical Retreats
Tactical_Retreats_desc코0=By retreating at an advantageus time, we can preserve our forces while strengthening other areas. As the enemy cannot afford to protect all retaken areas suficciently, we can always return to most of them later. By denying the enemy any desicive victory, we can wear out their morale.
Covert_Relocation코0=Covert Relocation
Covert_Relocation_desc코0=By having the strategic depth to move around forces and not caring about our own territorial integrity, we can covertly relocate forces to where the enemy is weak, gaining decisive advantages.
Autonomus_Combat_Cells코0=Autonomus Combat Cells
Autonomus_Combat_Cells_desc코0=Decentralizing the command structure so that very small groups can operate independently, while at the same time ensuring that no single person or group can identify several other groups, we disrupt the enemy intelligence gathering efforts.
Tunnel_Warfare코0=Tunnel Warfare
Tunnel_Warfare_desc코0=Building extensive networks of underground tunnels allows covert re-supply, shifting of forces and better defences through ambush opportunities. As the enemy cannot use airpower or armored units inside tunnels, the disparity of forces is equalized.

Mimicking_operations코0=Mimicking Operations
Mimicking_operations_desc코0=WIP
Rhizome_Manoeuver코0=Rhizome Manoeuver
Rhizome_Manoeuver_desc코0=An tactic for urban areas, the Rhizome Manoeuver is essentially "walking through walls", treating the urban enviroment not as a grid of streets, but as a flexible, almost liquid medium, forever in flux. This allows for unobserved movement and unexpected attacks. It can further be enchanced by the unprecedented mobility of having special units trained in parkour.
Light_Infantry_Focus코0=Light Infantry Focus
Light_Infantry_Focus_desc코0=Focusing on light infantry to deliver ambushes and attacks allows us to scale up the insurgency and be more proficient at the conventional warfare nessesary to take full control over an territory.
IED_and_Mine_Focus코0=IED and Mine Focus
IED_and_Mine_Focus_desc코0=Specializing in using improvised explosive devicies (IED) and land mines, we can force the opponent to move very slowly in any offensive against us, making them predictible and easier to avoid. The psychological impact of constant attrition from IED's against convoys can also demoralize the enemy. This approach allows us to deliver casualities to the enemy without sustaining them ourselves.
Cult_of_Martyrs코0=Cult of Martyrs
Cult_of_Martyrs_desc코0=Celebrating the sacrifice of lives for an cause turns it into an religious dimension, which is an powerful ideological tool to recruit others to our cause.
Suicide_Bombings코0=Suicide Bombings
Suicide_Bombings_desc코0=If convictions are strong enough, humans can be made to volunteer the ultimate sacrifice, taking the enemy with them into their graves. The powerful idea behind this is that the volunteer does not have to be trained to be effective.

Lone_Wolf_Terrorism코0=Lone Wolf Terrorism
Lone_Wolf_Terrorism_desc코0=Through propaganda we can encourage isolated actors to engage in solo terror attacks, usually against civilian targets. The aim is to spread fear and chaos, and changing the political landscape of the enemy through that fear. This can make them overreach or retaliate excessively, fueling the cycle of violence that our support is based on.
Major_Terror_Attacks코0=Major Terror Attacks
Major_Terror_Attacks_desc코0=Staging well-planned terror attacks against symbolic or military targets will grant us the attention of the world, increasing our prestige and boosting our recruitment. The more spectacular the attack, the better for us. We may, however, gain more enemies.
Cyber_Propaganda코0=Cyber Propaganda
Cyber_Propaganda_desc코0=By taking the battle into cyberspace, we can manipulate the discourse. Opponents can be made to become more extremist, leading soft supporters of ours to become more loyal to our cause. Cyber attacks and infiltration in popular websites can also help us spread our propaganda.
ThreeD_Swarming코0=3D Swarming
ThreeD_Swarming_desc코0=3D Dimensional Swarming sees the layout of built up areas and the nature of urban combat not as street-to-street fighting, but as multifaceted killzones where vertically prepared combat positions join to create attacks from all directions simultainously. Controlling the approach of the enemy using mines and booby-traps, we lure them into certain death, while moving from buildings to buildings by tunnels to ensure flexibility as we avoid getting pinned down and can reinforce positions as needed.
Networked_Battlefield코0=Networked Battlefield
Networked_Battlefield_desc코0=As software continues to move into an ever more critical role on the battlefield we must ensure that our forces are never lacking on this growing front. By utilizing the latest in these systems we can ensure our forces function like one organism constantly operating and updating from the movements of others.
Maneuver_Warfare코0=Maneuver Warfare
Maneuver_Warfare_desc코0=Maneuver warfare doctrine sees styles of warfare as a spectrum with attrition warfare and maneuver warfare on opposite ends. In attrition warfare, the enemy is seen as a collection of targets to be found and destroyed. Attrition warfare exploits maneuver to bring to bear firepower to destroy enemy forces. Maneuver warfare, on the other hand, exploits firepower and attrition on key elements of opposing forces.
Sensor_Capability_Integration코0=Sensor Capability Integration
Sensor_Capability_Integration_desc코0=Advanced sensor fusion enables units to draw on information from all of their equipped sensors to create a single integrated picture of the battlefield. All of the information gathered is then automatically shared with other units and command and control operating centers on their network using the most modern datalinks.
Rapid_Dominance코0=Rapid Dominance
Rapid_Dominance_desc코0=Imposing Rapid Dominance will impose this overwhelming level of Shock and Awe against an adversary on an immediate or sufficiently timely basis to paralyze its will to carry on, to seize control of the environment, and paralyze or so overload an adversary's perceptions and understanding of events that the enemy would be incapable of resistance at the tactical and strategic levels.
RTSA코0=RTSA
RTSA_desc코0=Real Time Situational Awareness (RTSA) capability enables aircrews to communicate with ground crews during airlift, airdrop, and many other operations.Increased complexity of combat operations demands that aircrews process and respond to incoming information rapidly to meet mission goals.
Shock_Awe코0=Cyber Shock & Awe
Shock_Awe_desc코0=A new approach to shock and awe, as well as a new vision to the prelude of an attack, "Cyber" shock and awe seeks to disable enemy infrastructure, energy supply, economy, and communications before the first shot has ever been fired.

Resilient_Communications코0=Resilient Communications
Resilient_Communications_desc코0=Disaster-based failures can seriously disrupt a communication network, making its services unavailable. Such disruptions may follow from natural disasters, technology-related failures, or malicious attacks. These disruptions are observably increasing in number, intensity and scale. The problem needs to be urgently addressed, due to a the lack of suitable mechanisms deployed in current networks. When network services that are part of a critical infrastructure become unavailable, commercial and/or societal problems are the inevitable result.
Full_Spectrum_Dominance코0=Full Spectrum Dominance
Full_Spectrum_Dominance_desc코0= also known as full-spectrum superiority, is a military entity's achievement of control over all dimensions of the battlespace, effectively possessing an overwhelming diversity of resources in such areas as terrestrial, aerial, maritime, subterranean, extraterrestrial, psychological, and bio- or cyber-technological warfare.Full spectrum dominance includes the physical battlespace; air, surface and sub-surface as well as the electromagnetic spectrum and information space. Control implies that freedom of opposition force assets to exploit the battlespace is wholly constrained.
Target_Aquisition_Computing코0=Target Aquisition Computing
Target_Aquisition_Computing_desc코0=Ai/ATR is an extremely important technology for military operations that has not yet realized its full tactical promise. A fully reliable Ai/ATR can enhance lethality and survivability of the war fighter and platform. An Ai/ATR operates on sensor data in order to process information for decision making. The primary value added to a weapons system of an Ai/ATR is engagement timeline reduction for target(s) acquisition.
Freedom_Of_Maneuver코0=Freedom Of Maneuver

Multi_Domain_Battle_desc코0=Multidomain battle (MDB) is a concept designed to address this changing world. We must be able to get past our adversary’s integrated defensive capabilities, avoid domain isolation and fracturing, and preserve our freedom of action. We must be able to penetrate their defenses at a time and place of our choosing, in more than one domain, by opening windows of domain superiority to allow maneuver inside our adversary’s integrated defense.
Air_Blitzkrieg코0=Air Blitzkrieg
Air_Blitzkrieg_desc코0=Specifiying on the air component of Rapid Dominance, this strategy brings all of our Air Power to bear in a fast mobilisation eliminating and weakining all adversery domains before they can mount an effective defense.

High_Lethality코0=High Lethality
High_Lethality_desc코0=No, wounding, crippling, or disabling. This doctrine solidifies the effort that in order for our weapons and our military to be most effective not only in actual combat but also as a deterrent, they must be as lethal as possible.

Covert_Deception_desc코0=Psychological operations, information warfare, visual deception and other methods. As a form of strategic use of information (disinformation), it overlaps with psychological warfare. To the degree that any enemy that falls for the deception will lose confidence when it is revealed, he may hesitate when confronted with the truth.
Three_Dimensional_warfare코0=Three Dimensional Warfare
Three_Dimensional_warfare_desc코0=The notion of 3D tactics has been developed from the spherical security concept. The 3D tactics model identifies some of the key phenomenon experienced in urban environments. In particular, the 'inherent information deception qualities' found in 'vertical rather than horizontal envelopment'.

Rapid_strike_desc코0=Further focusing on the speed and mobility of action, our units can move more cohesivley faster and therefore limiting our adversaries ability to respond effectivley.
Siege_warfare코0=Siege Warfare
Siege_warfare_desc코0=This strategy is an incorporation of new methods to defeat typical features of modern sieges, as the defender has greater capacity to withstand the siege, the attacker's main aim is to bottle operational forces or create a strategic distraction, rather than take the siege to a conclusion.
Close_combat_lethality코0=Close Combat Lethality
Close_combat_lethality_desc코0=The CCLTF will analyze and provide focused recommendations on Military Service efforts to achieve overmatch to ensure infantry squads are never in a fair fight. Overcoming this problem will require changes to infantry squad manpower management, training and equipping—changes that enhance lethality and survivability, thereby achieving overmatch.
Casualty_Retention코0=Casualty Retention
Casualty_Retention_desc코0=We need to seriously rethink the methods and practices by which we deal with combat casualties. Remembering that a casualty does not always necessarily mean that the indivdual cannot return to combat, as well recent medical advances have made once traditonally long-term injuries into ailments that can be more qucikly treated.
Concentration_of_Force코0=Concentration Of Force
Concentration_of_Force_desc코0=We need to focus on concentrating a military force so as to bring to bear such overwhelming force against a portion of an enemy force that the disparity between the two forces alone acts as a force multiplier in favour of the concentrated forces.
Decapitation_Strike코0=Decapitation Strike
Decapitation_Strike_desc코0=A decapitation strike is a military strategy aimed at removing the leadership or command and control of a hostile government or group. The strategy of shattering or defeating an enemy by eliminating its military and political leadership has long been utilized in warfare ,but with the advent of more precision weapons we can apply this strategy on a more tactical scale against our enemies unit and field commanders.
Indiscriminate_Force코0=Indiscriminate Force
Indiscriminate_Force_desc코0=Total War applied on the tactical level, when presicion and advanced targeting fail us, and when our backs are against the wall, our forces need to be able to use all the resources at their diosposal to achieve victory by all means. This means no round, shell, rocket, or missle goes unfired whether the enemy is shielded by noncomabtants or not.
Unrestricted_Warfare코0=Unrestricted Warfare
Unrestricted_Warfare_desc코0=Reducing one's opponent can be accomplished in a number of ways other than direct military confrontation. These alternative methods have the same and even greater destructive force than military warfare, and they have already produced serious threats different from the past and in many directions for national security.
Networked_Swarming_Tactics코0=Networked Swarming Tactics
Networked_Swarming_Tactics_desc코0=Networked swarming warfare (NSW) is the wide-scope maneuver warfare to attack dynamically the enemy in parallel by flexible utilization of "assembly" and "dispersion", which integrates the multiple forces distributed widely into the operational network with obvious flowing feature in a multi-dimensional space.It provides us with a networked form of operations which allows organizational flowing that amount of dispersed combat units on battlefield could rapidly formulate the operational swarms which centering on objectives and rebuild according to the requirements of battlefield environment.
Assymetrical_Swarming코0=Assymetrical Swarming
Assymetrical_Swarming_desc코0=Much like swarming in the conventional sense, this method seeks to utilize only the tools of the unconventional such as insurgency, IED emplacement, and guerrilla warfare but on the scale of a massive conventional attack.

Eternal_Recurrence코0=Eternal Recurrence
Eternal_Recurrence_desc코0=Through study and as evidenced in the field, COIN operations as they have been instructed to be carried out and how they are actually being conducted are two very different things. We must ensure that our units adhere to the doctrines set forth for COIN operations if we are to make any visible progress as the current path is evidenced to be ineffective.
Tactical_Flexibility코0=Tactical Flexibility
Tactical_Flexibility_desc코0=Though many of the past doctrines have been meant to improve tactical flexibility in one way or another, this doctrine seeks to take a grand look at all of our efforts and correlate them as best as possible to give the ability to change tactics easily and readily to meet new circumstances and conditions.
Battlespace_Dispersion코0=Battlespace Dispersion
Battlespace_Dispersion_desc코0=When the situation does arise that meeting our foes directly would mean sure defeat, one strategy we can make use of is a modern version of defeat in detail in which we spread out the battlefield as much as possible while leaving our most mobile units the capacity to quickly resolve the resulting smaller conflicts in our favor.
Economy_of_force코0=Economy of Force
Economy_of_force_desc코0=No part of a force should ever be left without purpose. The allocation of available combat power to such tasks, like limited attacks, defense, delays, deception or even retrograde operations is measured, in order to achieve mass at decisive points elsewhere on the battlefield.
Strategic_Defense코0=Strategic Defense
Strategic_Defense_desc코0=Strategic Defense requires that a defender deploy its resources, such as fortifications, field works and military units at and well behind the front line. Although attackers may find it easier to breach the more weakly defended front line, as they advance, they continue to meet resistance. As they penetrate deeper, their flanks become vulnerable, and, should the advance stall, they risk being enveloped.
